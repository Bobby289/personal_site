		<h2>1. Earlier Life and Back Ground</h2>
		<p>
			I was born on 16<sup>th</sup> of the november in <a href="https://www.medindia.net/patients/hospital_search/kommalapati-veeraiah-nursing-home-prakasam-andhra-pradesh-23602-1.htm" target="_blank">K V Nursing Home Hospital</a> at Ongole as an Christian in Middle Class Family without any Background. My Father's Name is Naligala Ratna Vara Kumar, Mother's Name is Naligala Radhika Ratna and Sister's Name is Naligala Rohini Ratna. My Father has 5 siblings and he is the thrid one actually. They really more affectionative to eachother without any obsessions. We(Our whole Family) used to meet yearly atleast one time at the time of <code><big>Christmas</big></code>. And Finally, their love sharing and affectionative among each other inspiring to me as well as our Generation. At the begining, I said to you guys that I have no background but that was wrong atually I have a background which is so called My<mark>Family</mark>.  
		</p>
		<h2>2. My Eductional Life</h2>
		<p>
			You guys might be at shock if you know this thing, that is My bother-in-law,sister-in-law,sister,and both brother and me as well are studied from <code>Nursery</code>to 10<sup>th</sup> standard and passed out in one and only one School named as <big>Sri Sarada Bala kutter</big>. And coming to my personal School life, when ever we listen a word called school a word strikes to our mind that is our <mark>Friends</mark>. I also have many friends in my school days ,those moments me and my friends enjoyed together, fight together, scolded each other and bullied each other are still remains in mind. Those are really golden days to any person actually. And then I got a seat through <big>JEE MAINS</big> in <a href="http://www.iiitdmj.ac.in">IIITDMJ</a> at jabalpur.

		<h2>3. Co-Curricural Activities</h2>
		<p>
			There are very few Co-Curricural activities like Karate, Drawing, Fancy dress competition and Easy writing. I got many prices, awards and certificates in these individual activities. I owned Brown 1 belt in karate , I learned Drawing by taking 3 summer couching and I done myself with my own interest to participate in Fancy dress competition throughout my schooling.
		</p>
		<h2>4. My Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Playing indour game</li>
				<li>Watching movies</li>
				<li>watching cricket while Dhoni playing</li>
			</ol>
			I play mobile or PC or Play Station games with much more interest. I will enjoy will playing the games. Playing games is my favourite hobby as well. When I was used to time pass, then I will definatly watch movies. And coming to my favourite ever is watching India's cricket live especially while <mark>MS Dhoni</mark> playing.
		</p>
